# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Airline-Tweets
n this project, I will analyze the user tweets about the airlines performance in the US which was taken from Twitter in 2015. I will clean and preprocess the data and try to fix the imbalance of the data and finally create four models to analyze Sentiment of the tweets, and that will return whether the tweets convey positive, neutral or negative sentiment.
This analysis can be useful for the airline company to know what are the reasons for the disappointments of their company and where they should focus to work on.
For this work Python with: Pandas, jupyter notebook and scikit learning libraries will be used.
2. Data description and data cleaning
Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service"). The original dataset was collected from https://data.world/crowdflower/airline-twitter-sentiment. Then it was processed using this repository https://github.com/benhamner/crowdflower-airline-twitter-
sentiment/blob/master/Makefile.
